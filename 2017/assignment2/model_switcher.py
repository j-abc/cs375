    Description:
        model switcher is a wrapper around models.py.
    Inputs:
        model_name: name of model within models.py
        data_name:  name of data source
    Stores:
        dbname:   as data_name
        collname: as model_name
        layers:   as layer names associated with our model
                  for now this is hard coded
        model_fn: a reference to the model definition as imported from models.py
    Example:
        from model_switcher import *
        my_model = model_switcher(model_name = 'layers', data_name = 'cifar10')
        # now we can access dbname, collname, and layers from my_model
