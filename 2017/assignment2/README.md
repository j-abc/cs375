# Assignment 1

## Network Training

Train on CIFAR-10: 
- A shallow bottleneck convolutional autoencoder model (John)
- A pooled version of a shallow bottleneck convolutional autoencoder model (John)
- Sparse  version of  a shallow bottleneck convolutional autoencoder model (John)
- Sparse version of a pooled version of a shallow bottleneck convolutional autoencoder model (John)
- A deep symmetric convolutional autoencoder (Ramon)
- A Variational Autoencoder (Ramon)
- The Colorful Image Colorization network (Ramon)

Train on Imagenet:
- The Colorful Image Colorization network (TBA)
- Best of the other networks (TBA)


## Network Evaluation

Evaluations to run (Sophia):
- Perform the task generalization
- RSA 
- neural fitting
- filter visualization evaluations
- linear classifier from the features at that layer to solve Imagenet

Do this for each trained model, for every relevant time step, for each relevant layer.
